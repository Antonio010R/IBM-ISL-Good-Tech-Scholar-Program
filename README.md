FastPay - Digital Wallet (Digital Transformation for social change)

Problem Definition:

People with limited experience with technology and poor financial literacy such as elderly people and people who live in the rural areas find it difficult to navigate and use digital wallets and payment gateways like Google Pay, PayTM, PhonePe, PayPal and bank apps like SBI YONO. 

Abstract:

Elder people are generally less inclined to use modern technology. People living in rural areas are unaware of how to utilize such platforms and their services. Often, they seek help from others, divulging their sensitive information like passwords and making them vulnerable to scams. To overcome these challenges, a simple mobile based application can be developed that helps all users to easily manage their finances online by themselves. 

The basic functions of the application that user sees are:

Send Money

Pay Bills

Transaction History

Check Balance

The UI can be a basic simplified layout and users can select their local language for their ease and comfort.
